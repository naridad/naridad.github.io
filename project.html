            There is a lack of phone apps that provide a free way to read manga from all sorts of different sources.
            Currently, there are a myriad of phone apps that allow people to read manga, but the sources are limited and unable to add to, or you have to pay to read manga.
            On the other hand, there are a number of websites that provide thousands of manga for free.
            Being able to read manga on the phone in a single place is more important than jumping from website to website and manually keeping track of what you have and have not read.

          <td colspan="2" class="extra-padding-left-small, light-gray"">
            We can build an app that grabs the manga images/pdf sources from the websites and allows you to curate your library from that one single app.
            Since there are websites that provide the manga for free, the app would be like reading from the website but you can include bookmarks, chapters read, and keep track of your collection of reading material as you read.
            My solution is unique because all other attempts at this do not provide the ability to read manga for free for a wide array of sources.
            Charging for basic access to this service is a mistake because there already is a large community of sourcing and making access to anime/manga entirely free.
            Paid membership can offer more organization features for the users who use the service the most which can guarantee steady revenue.

            The first target customer is someone who already reads a lot of manga.
            They have a collection of websites that provide the manga rather than a collection of the manga itself and they manually keep track in their notes what they’ve read. 
            The second target customer is someone who already enjoys anime or has read a few manga, but because of the barrier of entry to begin reading more manga, they don’t dive any deeper than watching anime.
            This is limiting because a large portion of anime come from manga and there are many more manga than there are anime.
            This will appeal most to people of any gender between the ages 14 and 25 and is roughly 50% the size of those who already enjoy anime, which has been growing significantly ever since Covid.

            My passion already heavily overlaps with this service because I am the target customer.
            I already read a vast amount of manga and have been searching for years for a simple solution to this problem but have constantly been disappointed in the execution.
            My relevant expertise includes web scraping as I have participated on several projects that have involved scraping web content to serve to the user in a different way.
            The project requires a focus on backend and UI design.
            Keep the app simple for the user while providing an efficient and moldable method to combine sources into one database for the user.
