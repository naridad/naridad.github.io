            Currently, there are a myriad of phone apps that allow people to read manga, but the sources are limited or you have to pay to read.
            On the other hand, there are a number of websites that provide thousands of manga for free.
            Additionally, there is no single website that has every manga available.
            Being able to read manga on the phone in a single place is more convenient than jumping from website to website and manually keeping track of what you have and have not read.

            An app that allows you to curate your library from that one single app.
            Since there are websites that provide the manga for free, the app would be like reading from the website but you can include bookmarks, chapters read, and keep track of your collection of reading material as you read.
            My solution is unique because all other attempts do not provide ease of use, combining sources, and 
            Charging for basic access to this service is a mistake because there already is a large community of sourcing and providing access to anime/manga entirely free.
            Paid membership can offer more features but should not discriminate against free users.

            The first target customer is someone who already reads a lot of manga.
            They have a collection of websites that provide the manga rather than a collection of the manga itself and they manually keep track in their notes what they’ve read. 
            Secondly is someone who already enjoys anime or has read a few manga, but because of the barrier of entry to begin reading more manga they don’t dive any deeper than watching anime.
            This will appeal most to teens to those in their mid 20s and is roughly 50% the size of those who already enjoy anime.

            My passion already heavily overlaps with this service because I am the target customer.
            I already read a vast amount of manga and have been searching for years for a simple solution to this problem but have constantly been disappointed in the execution.
            My relevant expertise includes web scraping as I have participated on several projects that have involved scraping web content.
            The project's two most important features is consistent media retrieval and simple but purposeful UI design.
            Keep the app simple for the user while providing an efficient and moldable method to combine sources into one database for the user.
